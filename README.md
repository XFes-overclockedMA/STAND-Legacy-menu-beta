💎 You too are nostalgic for the era of GTA 360 mods so I offer you this theme which aims to best resemble the original menu (Legacy menu beta) on xbox 360 JTAG.🔥🧨

🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧

I also made the Theme Superior V for even more nostalgia👌
💎 Superior V : Github link cooming soon please look on STAND server discord

🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧

I am aware that everything is not perfect in this theme I can't promise to make another version to improve it but if I can I would do it with great pleasure, if necessary I can provide the .PSD that I did for the HEADER. 🐍

🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧

SPECIAL MENTION: @Beyond 5D  Who gave me the idea given that he had already made a version thank you very much to him!! ✨❤️

🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧🚧

I also recommend the two themes posted by @Grampa#1978  : "African Engine", for even more nostalgia❤️❤️

Good game  😉🚀🎮
